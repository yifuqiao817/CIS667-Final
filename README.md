# CIS667-Final

The full version of text-based chess game is in yqiao08_Final.py. Simply run its main function, you will be able to choose problem sizes, AI or manually. 

You can also run AI_match_forTest() to see how NN-based AI match tree-based AI in 100 games for each problem size. 

The pytorch parameters for each network is attached. 

The training data are too large to upload. You can also run AI_match_forData() to generate new data. 

Thank you for the semester and have a good holiday!
